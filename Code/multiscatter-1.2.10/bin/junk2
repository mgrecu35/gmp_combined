Instrument characteristics:
   Wavelength: 0.00857 m
   Gaussian transmitter pattern 1/e half-width: 1 radians
   Number of fields-of-view: 1
   Top-hat receiver pattern half-width(s) in radians: 0.0062173
   Altitude: 400000 m
   Distance to first gate: 380125 m
   Receiver full-width footprint at first gate: 4726.7 m
The output from the following algorithm(s) are summed:
   Single scattering
   Wide-angle scattering using time-dependent two-stream (TDTS) method assuming no forward lobe
      Coherent backscatter enhancement: 1
The backscatter due to particulates and air will be reported separately (e.g. for HSRL or Raman)
