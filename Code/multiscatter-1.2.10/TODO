Things to do:

Interface
 - Documentation
 - Formalize Quickbeam interface

Small-angle code
 - Fix resolution-dependence in multiscatter_qsa.c
 - Remove thread-unsafe aspects of H06 algorithm

Wide-angle code
 - Benchmark adjoint
 - Polarization
 - Doppler
 - Make sure "-wide-angle-cutoff" for aerosols feeds through to
   wide-angle part of code
 - Check the spatial discretization of the ms_variance algorithm
 - New ADonly functions for TDTS expansion
 - Superluminal is an option
 
Jacobians etc
 - Do numerical Jacobian of wide-angle code with reduced resolution
   for efficiency
 - Do tangent linear model
 * Adjoint of wide-angle with optimized gates
 - Adjoint of wide-angle with interpolation
